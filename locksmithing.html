      <h4>Disassembly:</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>Remove the C clip and tailpiece from the back of the lock.
</li>
	<li>Insert the key, and open the lock
</li>
	<li>Using the plug follower, push the plug out the front of the lock, being careful not to spill the pins in the plug.
</li>
	<li>Remove the key pins from the plug and put them in the pinning tray, be sure not to confuse their order.
</li>
	<li>Slowly slide the plug follower out of the lock and collect the top pins and springs as they fall out of the body, and put them in the pinning tray. Their order does not matter, unless there are master pins in the lock.
</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Assembly:</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>Using tweezers, insert the springs into their chambers in the lock.
</li>
	<li>Insert the plug follower from the back of the lock, but stop before it covers the rearmost pin hole.
</li>
	<li>Using tweezers, Insert the pin and push the pin from the back using the follower so that the spring cannot push it out from its hole.
</li>
	<li>Using the tweezers. push the pin down into its hole, and cover it using the plug follower.
</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each successive pin until all the top pins are in the lock body.
</li>
	<li>Put the key into the plug, and put the key pins into their holes in the plug. Now is a good time to make sure all of the pins sit flush in their holes, so that the key will work when the lock is reassembled.
</li>
	<li>Insert the plug into the lock body, using it to push the plug follower out the back of the lock.
</li>
	<li><b>Be sure to put the c clip and tailpiece onto the back of the lock before you try to remove the key, otherwise you will dump pins everywhere and have to start over. (ask me how I know this)

      <h1 align = "center">Cutting a key</h1>
      <hr>
      <h4>Cutting a key from a bitting code:</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>Using a set of calipers, measure the spacing of the cuts from the shoulder of they key, I like to file small notches into the key blank to mark it.
</li>
	<li>Use the set of calipers to mark the depths of each pin underneath the notches. I just set my calipers to the bitting depth and use them to inscribe a small line on the blank.
</li>
	<li>Using the key cutting pliers, cut the key blank at the correct spacing down to the inscribed line on the blank. Remember, it is better to have to cut twice than to have a ruined key, there is no way to undo a cut if it is too deep.
</li>
	<li>Repeat step 3 until the key is fully cut to approximately the right depth.
</li>
	<li>At this point, I disassemble my lock and insert the key to see if the pins are at the right depths.
</li>
	<li>If not, note which pins are sticking up the highest and cut the key deeper in those spots.
</li>
	<li>Once you get close enough, you can use a set of needle files to get the finishing touches done.
</li>
	<li><i>Note: if you barely pull the key out and some pins pop up but they were at the right height before, you may want to expand the cut sideways towards the tip of the key. The same goes for the reverse, if a pin is at the right height but pops up when you push the key all the way in, expand the cut sideways towards the shoulder of the key using either the key cutting pliers or files.
</i></li>
	<li>For deep cuts, the pliers leave a vertical angle near the top of the cut, which causes the key to jam in the lock, just file the vertical parts down until they are at the same angle as the rest of the cut.
</li>
	<li><i>Note: If your key only works when pushed hard into the lock, you can try filing down the shoulder of the key so that it sits further in the lock, although it is recommended to try and find which pin is popping up and expanding the corresponding cut sideways. (see step 8)
</i></li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Cutting a key from an existing key:</h4>
      <ol>
	<li>Align the key and the blank next to each other, so that the blank is behind the key. If the key has a hole in the head, try using a small bolt to hold them together so that they don’t misalign while you are working.
</li>
	<li>Use the key cutting pliers to cut matching notches into the blank (the already cut key should prevent you from cutting too deep)
</li>
	<li>Use needle files to file the blank down the rest of the way, and remove and vertical angles (see step 9 of Cutting a key from a bitting code)
</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Cutting a key from depth keys*:</h4>

      <p><b>*A depth key is a key that has all the same cut depth for each cut, they usually come in sets, 1 key for each depth. By using these, you can get the accuracy of duplicating a key without having to duplicate it’s bitting.
</b></p>
      <ol>
	<li>Find the depth key that has the same bitting depths as your desired first cut.
</li>
	<li>Clamp or mount the two keys together so that they can’t move, side by side.
</li>
	<li>Cut the first position and swap out the depth key to whichever depth key is needed for your desired second cut.
</li>
	<li>Repeat steps 2-3 until the key is fully cut to approximately the right depth.
</li>
	<li>Use a set of needle files to get the finishing touches done, usually the key cutting pliers cut slightly too shallow.
</li>
